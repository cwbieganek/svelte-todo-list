# SvelteKit To Do List App

The classic To Do list app built using SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Has the following features:

- Multiple categories for tasks (personal, work, other)
- Multiple priorities for tasks (low, medium, high)
- Add task, remove a task, or remove all tasks
- Mark tasks as complete

## Components

I tried to the break the application into as many small, modular components as possible.

- Header
- AddTaskForm
- Category
- Task

##

To see the app in action, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
